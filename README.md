# ![W3C Logo](https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home) DID Test Suite

This test suite performs interoperability tests on the W3C
[Decentralized Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) specification and
is maintained by the W3C [DID Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/).

## Adding Your DID Implementation

There are three types of implementations that this test suite tests:
DID Methods, DID Resolvers, and DID URL Dereferencers. In order to add
your implementation to this test suite:

1. Add your input file(s) to the [implementations](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/tree/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites/implementations) directory. For an example, see the [example DID Method implementation](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/blob/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites/implementations/did-example-didwg.json) (or any other file that looks closest to your implementation in the directory).
2. Add your input file to all relevant `default.js` test suite configurations. For example, DID Methods should add themselves to the did-identifier, did-core-properties, did-production, and did-consumption suites. Resolver implementations should only be added to the did-resolution test suite. See the [current list of implementations listed for did-core-properties](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/blob/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites/did-core-properties/default.js) for more information. Implementers might want to peruse the [list of all the test suites](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/tree/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites) for more detail.
3. Run the test suite and make sure your implementation passes.
4. Submit a pull request on this repository to add your implementation.

## Adding and Modifying Tests

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes
to the test suite. Please make branch names informativeâ€”by including the
issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct
spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing
contributions.

## Code of Conduct

W3C functions under a [code of conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

## Getting Started

See the [Test Server](./packages/did-core-test-server).

To generate a report, run:

```npm
npm i
npm run test-and-generate-report
```

## If tests are failing

- Every time after updating any code, run `npm i`.
