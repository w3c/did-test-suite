      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are at least two
interoperable implementations of processors that are capable of generating
output that is conformant with the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">
Decentralized Identifiers</a> spec.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Testing Methodology</h2>

        <p>
The testing framework for the Decentralized Identifiers executes the
following process for every conformance statement in the
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">
Decentralized Identifiers</a> spec.:
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take an input file template that exercises the feature and feed it to a
developer provided DID generator.
          </li>
          <li>
If the input is valid, generate a DID that is conformant
to the spec.
          </li>
          <li>
The test suite then ensures that the generated DID is
conformant to the feature being tested.
          </li>
        </ol>
