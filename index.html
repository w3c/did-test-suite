        This document is under active development and implementers are advised
        against using the document unless they are directly involved with the

      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The DID Core Specification strives to make no untestable normative
        statements with [[RFC2119]] Language.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document attempts to demonstrate that all such language has been
        tested, and is supported by at least 2 independent implementations.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
        This document does not contain a comprehensive lists of normative
        statements made by the did core spec.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">Not all statements in this document have been tested.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Suite</h2>
        <p>
          A test suite is a collection of tests and a json suite configuration
          file.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Example json suite configuration">          {
            "name": "test-suite-a",
            "a": 1,
            "b": 2
          }          
          </pre>

        <pre class="example" title="Example javascript test file">let { suiteConfig } = global;

if (!suiteConfig) {
  suiteConfig = require("./defaultSuiteConfig.json");
}

describe("test-suite-a", () =&gt; {
  it("suite config should have correct name", async () =&gt; {
    expect(suiteConfig.name).toBe("test-suite-a");
  });

  it("a should be 1", async () =&gt; {
    expect(suiteConfig.a).toBe(1);
  });

  it("b should be 2", async () =&gt; {
    expect(suiteConfig.b).toBe(2);
  });
});
          </pre>
        <p></p>

        <p>Test Suites MUST have unique descriptive names.</p>

        <p class="note">
          For the purposes of the DID Core WG, the suite name is assumed to be
          "did-spec". However, we may choose to add additional test suites, with
          different names in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Test suites MAY be split into positive and negative cases.</p>

        <p>
          A suite is considered passing when all associated tests are passing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p>Normative statements are mapped to one or more tests.</p>
        <pre class="example" title="Example normative statement">          The DID method name MUST be an ASCII lowercase string.
          </pre>

        <pre class="example" title="Example test of statement">it('The DID method name MUST be an ASCII lowercase string.', () =&gt; {
  const method = did.split(':')[1];
  expect(utils.isAsciiString(method)).toBe(true);
  expect(method.toLowerCase()).toBe(method);
});
          </pre>
        <p>Tests SHOULD match normative statements in the DID Core.</p>
        <p>
          Tests SHOULD reuse utility functions like
          <code>isAsciiString</code>, or <code>decodeBase64UrlToString</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Suite Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          In order to run a test suite, a configuration file must be provided
          for the test file to be run against.
        </p>

        <p>Multiple suites can be run at once.</p>

        <h2>Raw Test Suite Run Result</h2>
        <p>
          Test results are produced by <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a>,
          with a post processing filter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both console and JSON output are provided.
          The member <code>suitesReportTerminal</code> contains encoded captures
          from standard out and error, and can be safely ignored.
        </p>
